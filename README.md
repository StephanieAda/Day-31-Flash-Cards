# Day-31-Flash-Cards
French Language Flash Cards GUI

Learn 100 French words from a CSV file.

The CSV file is turned into a dictionary.

The flashcards have 2 sides, a white side with a French word and the green side with the English translation

You have 3 seconds to translate it on your own before the card is flipped to the green side.

Click on the checkmark right button for words you get right and it'll be pulled from the dictionary and a CSV file containing the remaining dictionary contents will be created

So you can concentrate on only familiarizing yourself with French words you don't know.

Click the left X button for words you get wrong to move to the next French word, and retain the word in the CSV file.
